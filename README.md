# Programming-with-C
In this project, we used the scanf() function to take input from the user, and printf() function to display output to the user.
In order for this to work, we included the stdio.h header file using the #include <stdio.h> statement.
We use '%d' format specifier to print int types,
'%f' for float
'%lf' for double
'%c' for char.
We also made use of the break statement which ends the loop immediately when it is encountered.
However, the switch statement was used and it allows us to execute one code block among many alternatives.
